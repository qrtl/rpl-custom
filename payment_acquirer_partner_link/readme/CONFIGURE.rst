For customers that use the direct debit payment, assign the corresponding acquirer
accordingly. This can be done either through the partner form or the acquirer form.

Note the following for such kind of special acquirer:

#. Specific Countries field should be selected, AND
#. Countries field should be left blank, AND
#. Direct Debit should be selected.

If the first two points are missed, the direct debit acquirer may appear publicly
available on the website/portal, depending on the logic of the module that inherits
this one.

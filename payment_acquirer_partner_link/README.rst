This module does the following:

* Adds partner field to the payment acquirer model (many2many) which is supposed to be
  used for direct debit payment.
* Adds the acquirer field in account.invoice, and proposes a value based on the
  following logic:

  * If there is a payment transaction attached to the invoice, take the acquirer from
    the payment transaction.
  * Otherwise, take the acquirer from the commercial partner of the invoice.

The background
--------------

The direct debit payment method is exclusive to certain customers and should not be
made publicly available.

Configuration
=============

For customers that use the direct debit payment, assign the corresponding acquirer
accordingly. This can be done either through the partner form or the acquirer form.

Note the following for such kind of special acquirer:

#. Specific Countries field should be selected, AND
#. Countries field should be left blank, AND
#. Direct Debit should be selected.

If the first two points are missed, the direct debit acquirer may appear publicly
available on the website/portal, depending on the logic of the module that inherits
this one.

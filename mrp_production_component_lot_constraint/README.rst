This module does the following:

* Adds the component lot filter field to the manufacturing order, and checks
  the consistency between the filter value and the selected lots for the
  component products that have been indicated for checking.
* In case the component lot filter is not set and user selects a lot for a move
  with lot restriction, the lot filter is automatically populated.
* Disallow reservation of more than one lot per component line.
* Suggests the maximum producible quantity according to the lots selected for
  the component lines.
* Skip the stock reservation that is triggered in vanilla Odoo when production
  quantity is changed through the wizard, since it messes up the lot assignment
  done manually by the user. For the already reserved lots, alternatively, the
  reservation will be re-calculated according to the available quantities.

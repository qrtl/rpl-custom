This module adds the possibility to define a sequence for
the partner's reference. This reference is then set as default
when you create a new partner, using the defined sequence.

This module is a modification of the OCA base_partner_sequence module.

Modified point:

- Reference is assigned to all the partners, whether the partner is a commercial partner
  or not.

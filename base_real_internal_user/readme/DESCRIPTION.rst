This module adds the "Real Internal User" group.

The module is intended to be used in case there are "internal" users who do not
technically belong to the company but have been added as such in Odoo for a
reason (e.g. subcontractor users).

The module does not adjust the security settings by itself. The security settings
are to be adjusted in respective modules that inherit this one.
